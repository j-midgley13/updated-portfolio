# portfolio-hw2

Introduction
--------------
This is my initial commit for my homework 2, creating a portfolio for myself using Bootstrap elements.

Objective
--------------
My objective in this is to creat a deployed website portfolio that is mobile responsive.
I need to have a consistent navbar with links to Home, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
I must have valid and correct HTML pages with semantic tags. Must have my personalized information.
Lastly, complete this portfolio using bootstrap components and the grid system.

Summary
--------------
I created a static portfolio page using bootstrap elements. I found bootstraps' grid system a great tool to style a page. 
I tested the responsiveness and it looked like it went quite well! How to modify the bootstrap was a little tricky but I feel like I did a good job. 
I am excited to update this project as we go! Very fun.
